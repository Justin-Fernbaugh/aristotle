  * Clicking on students on the Students page for teachers now shows a tabular summary of the student assignments.
  * Assignment page for students and teachers has been switched from a simple list of assignment names to a tabular summary of grades and submissions.
  * UI improvements such as clearer course selection and render distinctions between finished and unfinished / graded and ungraded assignments.
  * Bug fixes.

  * Submitting text submissions to assignments as a student and viewing the grades once available.
