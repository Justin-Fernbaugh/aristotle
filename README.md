  * Added delete button for assignments on assignment details page
* 6/19/2021 (v0.1.1): Patch refining existing features:
  * Used CloudFlare proxy for HTTPS protocol to get website working on secure browsers (still unsafe due to half of protocol being unsecure)
  * Clicking on students on the Students page for teachers now shows a tabular summary of the student assignments.
  * Assignment page for students and teachers has been switched from a simple list of assignment names to a tabular summary of grades and submissions.
  * UI improvements such as clearer course selection and render distinctions between finished and unfinished / graded and ungraded assignments.
  * Bug fixes.

  * Creating courses as a teacher and joining them as a student using the course UUID.

  * Submitting text submissions to assignments as a student and viewing the grades once available.
